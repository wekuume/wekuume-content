#Wekuume Content repository

A platform to help mentors access and share practical reusable information and educational content. 

> Mentors are informal trainers supporting their colleagues, their professional network and their friends in the acquisition of knowledge and skills. 

### Wekuume heavily borrows content, workflow, design-principles and deployment from an earlier project - Open Mentoring: [openmentoring-content](https://github.com/iilab/openmentoring-content)
