# Appropriate response
How did you lose your device? Was it stolen by another person, taken by a state authority, or did you simply lose track of it? If this is an adversary you need to develop an appropriate response.
<br>
# Security protections
Were there any strong security protections in place, such as full disk encryption or password protections? This will help you to learn if files on your computer containing sensitive information are secure or not.
<br>
# Content and contacts
What information  was on your device, and what might harm your networks and  sources if it gets into the wrong hands? Securely Communicate with your networks to let them know.
<br>
# Device missing or returned
Is the device still missing or has it been returned? Be careful as you do not know who has had access to your device. Possibly treat it as if it is now untrusted or compromised.
