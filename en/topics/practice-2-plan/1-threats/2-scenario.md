Sheena is a Human Rights Defender with a blog that covers controversial issues, some of which have legal implications. She realises the community needs to understand specific provisions of some laws that protect their rights. Some actors are not in support of this and are determined to go to any length to stop her from sensitising the population. Sheena wants to understand the threats to herself and how to deal with them.
