## Packrat: Seven Years of a South American Threat Actor

This report describes an extensive malware, phishing, and disinformation campaign active in several Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil. The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters.

The group, which we name “Packrat,” came to our attention in 2015 when several Citizen Lab researchers began independently receiving reports of phishing and malware targeting journalists and public figures in Ecuador.  After some analysis, it became clear that this was the same group who had targeted a number of prominent figures in Argentina, including Argentinian special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was found dead in January 2015 under suspicious circumstances. Putting the pieces together it became clear that these reports were the tip of an iceberg.
